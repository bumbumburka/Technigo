  <h1>What is a browser?</h1>

    <p class="regulartext">
      A web browser or simply browser is a free program that is used for accessing the internet. Every time it shows us a webpage, the browser has to process all 
      provided information in HTML, which may include text, links and references to images and other items, such as cascading style sheets (CSS) and JavaScript 
      functions. This process is called rendering.
    </p>
    
    <p class="regulartext">
      Browsers are extensively used by all of us and sometimes even the only software that we use throughout the day. With that being said, security and privacy 
      standards as well as usability are something to look for, when you choose your browser. Wellknown and popular browsers are <b>Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla 
      Firefox</b> and <b>Microsoft Edge</b>.
